#	The function `computeStepsSamples` takes a timeseries of samples and computes
#	the number of steps.
#
#
#	The function `computeStepsMeasurement` takes a unsampled measurement and computes
#	the number of steps.
#
#	The function `start` reads from the appropriate sensor and sends the 
#	samples to computeSteps. The implementation of `start` in pedometer.n
#	is a basic one which works from a single 1-axis sensor. In practice,
#	start would continuously monitor three axes of a 3-axis accelerometer
#	to determine which one has the maximum peak-to-peak deviation for each
#	time window and would send the samples from that axis to computeSteps.
