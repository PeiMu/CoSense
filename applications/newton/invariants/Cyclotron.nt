#	Description: Particle (point-like) moving in a uniform magnetic field
#

include "NewtonBaseSignals.nt"

#
#	Initial velocities can be adjusted for each experiment
#
v_0 : constant = 1 * m * s ** -1;
v_1 : constant = 1 * m * s ** -1;
v_2 : constant = 1 * m * s ** -1;

#
#	Initial particle position is assumed to be (0; 0; 0) - easiness of dealing with the equations
#
x_0 : constant = 10 * m;
x_1 : constant = 10 * m;
x_2 : constant = 10 * m;

#
#	Magnetic field is uniform = (0; 0; B) - w.l.o.g. we can take B oriented along z direction (i.e., index '2' in our notation)
#
mfi : constant = 1 * T;

#
#	Particle weight
#
particleMass : constant = 1 * kg;

#
#	Particle charge
#
particleCharge : constant = 1 * C;

#
#	Error tolerances
#
a_e : constant = 0.001 * m * s ** -2;
v_e : constant = 0.001 * m * s ** -1;

period : invariant(t: time) = {
	t ~ particleMass * (particleCharge * mfi) ** -1
}

ZdirectionAccelerationAndVelocities : invariant(a: acceleration@2, v: speed@2) = {
	#
	#	z-direction acceleration
	#
	a > - a_e,

	#
	#	z-direction acceleration
	#
	a < a_e,

	#
	#	z-direction velocity
	#
	v > v_2 - v_e,

	#
	#	z-direction velocity
	#
	v < v_2 + v_e

#	Dimensional Matrix
#
#	    T   B   Q   M   V
#	s   1  -1   0   0  -1
#	m   0   0   0   0   1     -> therefore 5-4=1 invariant given by dimensional analysis
#	kg  0   1   0   1   0
#	C   0  -1   1   0   0
#
#	1 Tesla = kg / (C * s)  ->  not a fundamental unit in the above example
